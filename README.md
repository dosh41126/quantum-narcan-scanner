# 🧠 Quantum NARCAN Finder

The **Quantum NARCAN Finder** is a prototype desktop application built by **Graylan** to assist in real-time opioid overdose risk assessment and NARCAN (naloxone) access scanning. It combines quantum simulations, system metrics, hypertime evaluation, and AI-generated intelligence to offer urgent, potentially life-saving reports — starting with deployment in **Greenville, SC** and surrounding areas.

## 🚀 How It Works

When launched, the app:
1. Collects current location and road/path details.
2. Uses a **quantum hypertime engine** to scan CPU/RAM load and simulate overdose urgency.
3. Calls OpenAI (or Grok/Gemini) to generate a multi-part triage plan including:
   - Nearest NARCAN pickup points
   - Community harm reduction resources
   - Step-by-step rescue instructions
4. Offers low/medium/high **urgency levels** with discrete safety advice.
